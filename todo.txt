- *** Handle product price update with options prices in widget and popup ***

- Not supported: product price handling with price rules (qty > 1, or other conditions...)
=> solution in Product\Price controller: add product + quantity to quote, get quote total, then delete quote and keep total.
=> do that with ajax request to frontend product data controller
=> might avoid having to deal with price rules
